I’m a student from Bangladesh and want to learn IoT. I think it will be beneficial for educational purposes . But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course.In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn IoT in English.
 
I am a student of B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) department in Bangladeshi Public University Known as Islamic University,Bangladesh.This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute.

 It will help perform better in carrying out Internet of Things (IoT) and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. 

 I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
